# WordSimilarity

We'll be quantifying the similarity between pairs of words of a dataset using different methods with the word co-occurrence in the Brown corpus and synset structure of WordNet. Firstly, we will preprocess the dataset to filter out the rare and ambiguous words. Secondly, we will calculate the similarity scores for pairs of words in the filtered dataset using Lin similarity, NPMI and LSA. Lastly, we will quantify how well these methods work by comparing to a human annotated gold-standard.
